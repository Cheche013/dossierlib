Ex 0: The idea is to start with the method that greets me using my first name, then add a return so that afterwards it asks me for it.

Ex 1: Start with a basic pyramid, then apply the same concept but inverted → from top / going down , then from bottom \ going up /, making sure to specify the bricks and the spaces to build a diamond shape.

Ex 2: For the password, define each method for “set password / ask for password / display the unlock message.” The loop works using attempt because it will keep asking for the password until it is correct.

Ex 3: Define the possible dice rolls. Set a loop limit until reaching the 10th step of the staircase.
